# Geo Inference

Geo Inference is a light-weight Python package for performing feature extraction from high-resolution imagery using custom pre-trained foundation models. It provides a convenient way to extract features from large TIFF images and save the output as a TIFF file. It also supports converting the output mask to a polygon GeoJSON file and a YOLO CSV file.
